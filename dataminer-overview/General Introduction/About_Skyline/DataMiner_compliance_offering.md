# DataMiner compliance offering

## Annual security assessment

Skyline Communications takes pride in the security of its products and wants to provide the necessary guarantees to its users. For this purpose, among others, an annual security assessment of DataMiner is carried out by a third party, i.e. NVISO. They have ranked DataMiner's security posture as above average compared to other applications they have assessed in recent years.

## Azure and dataminer.services

All DataMiner services offered on dataminer.services run on  Microsoft Azure, which complies with ISO/IEC 27001 as well as multiple other standards. Azure uses internationally recognized processes and best practices to manage the infrastructure and organization that support and deliver its services. We work closely together with Microsoft to optimize the architecture of our service offering, making sure its security and reliability is up to the highest standards.

## NIS2 and CRA compliance

To ensure our compliance with the NIS2 directive of the European Parliament of December 2022, our external security partner NVISO has carried out an audit and provided us with a gap analysis. Based on this analysis, we are currently working to further strengthen our security.

We are also working on compliance with the European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) regulation, which imposes cybersecurity requirements for all connected products put on the EU market. This legal framework was introduced very recently in November 2024. Consequently, we are currently at an early stage of the gap-analysis phase.

## ISO/IEC 27001 compliance

In 2025, Skyline is planning to take the next step and aim towards attaining full ISO/IEC 27001 compliance as well. Initially, we are planning an extensive gap analysis, and based on this we are aiming to fully comply by the end of 2025 or early 2026. As there is a lot of overlap between this ISO standard and the NIS2 regulation, we expect that not many additional steps will be needed to attain this compliance.
