## New features

#### Elements can now be configured to run in isolation mode [ID 41758]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13] / 10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When you are editing an element, you can now indicate that it should run in isolation mode, i.e. in its own SLProtocol and SLScripting process.

To do so, go to *Advanced element settings*, and select the *Run in isolation mode* option.

When, in either the *protocol.xml* file or the *DataMiner.xml* file, the element in question is forced to run in isolation mode, the *Run in isolation mode* option will already be selected. In that case, clearing the option will not be possible.

For more information about running elements in isolation mode, see [Elements can now be configured to run in isolation mode [ID 41757]](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.5.4#elements-can-now-be-configured-to-run-in-isolation-mode-id-41757).
