### Fixes

#### Issue in SLNet could cause errors to be thrown in low-code apps [ID 40978]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.2 -->

Because of an issue in SLNet, after a restart of a DataMiner Agent, "not supported by the current server version" errors could get thrown in all low-code apps.

#### Problem when trying to update the protocol version of an element in error [ID 41962]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When you tried to update the protocol version of an element in error via DataMiner Cube, in some rare cases, a message would incorrectly appear, stating that it was not possible to update the element.

#### SLAnalytics: Memory leak due to an excessive number of messages being received following an alarm template update [ID 42047]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When an alarm template was updated, in some cases, the alarm focus manager could receive a excessive number of messages, causing SLAnalytics to leak memory.

#### DataMiner Taskbar Utility would incorrectly show a pop-up window when made to perform a DataMiner upgrade using the command prompt [ID 42135]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When you made SLTaskbarUtility perform a DataMiner upgrade using the command prompt, up to now, a pop-up window would appear when the DataMiner Agent was not running. As pop-up windows are only expected to appear when running in interactive mode, from now on, pop-up windows will no longer appear when you make SLTaskbarUtility perform actions using the command prompt.
