# Getting started with the InterApp framework

Begin by checking and making sure the [DataMiner requirements](xref:InterAppCalls_Introduction#dataminer-requirements) and [connector requirements](xref:InterAppCalls_Introduction#connector-requirements) are met.

Then follow these steps for development:

- [Creating an API](xref:InterAppCalls_GettingStarted_CreatingApi) with messages that define the data you want to share.
- [Creating an executor](xref:InterAppCalls_GettingStarted_CreatingExecutor) that defines how to process a message.
- [Receiving a call](xref:InterAppCalls_GettingStarted_ReceivingCall).
- [Sending a call](xref:InterAppCalls_GettingStarted_SendingCall).
