# Getting started with CI/CD using GitHub

## Getting started with CI/CD using GitHub for Connectors

If you and your organization are ready to dive into GitHub for Connectors, you will first need to set up your development environment.
Then you can start developing, releasing, and optionally deploying any supported DataMiner artifacts with a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub. To learn how to do so, follow the tutorial [Setting up complete quality control in CI/CD for connector deployment](xref:CICD_Tutorial_For_Connectors_VisualStudio_And_GitHub).

If you are specifically looking to create a quick custom pipeline to deploy connectors, follow the tutorial [Setting up basic CI/CD for connector deployment in GitHub](xref:CICD_Tutorial_Connector).

## Getting started with CI/CD using GitHub for non-connector items

Any artifact type beyond connectors can be packaged and deployed using our new Visual Studio Templates and the Skyline.DataMiner.SDK.

You'll find a few tutorials here that give a quick demonstration:

- [Using Visual Studio and DIS](xref:CICD_Tutorial_For_Other_Items_User_Defined_API_VisualStudio_And_GitHub)
- [Using GitHub Codespaces](xref:CICD_Tutorial_For_Other_Items_User_Defined_API_GitHub_Codespaces)
- [Creating Multi-Artifact Packages](xref:CICD_Tutorial_For_Other_Items_Multi-Artifact_DataMiner_Package_VisualStudio_And_GitHub)
