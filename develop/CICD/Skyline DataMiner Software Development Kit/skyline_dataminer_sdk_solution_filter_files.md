# Visual Studio 2022 Solution Filter (*.slnf) Files

A **Solution Filter** (`.slnf`) file in Visual Studio 2022 is a feature designed to load a subset of projects within a larger solution (`.sln`).

In large development projects, such as a complex **.NET** or **C#** application, solutions may consist of tens or hundreds of projects. Loading the entire solution can slow down the IDE, especially when you only need to work on a few core projects. Solution filters provide a way to:

- Load only necessary projects.
- Reduce Visual Studio's memory footprint.
- Speed up build and debugging times for targeted development.

Within Skyline DataMiner SDK they provide an additional key benefit.
You can easily publish or build a specific subset of projects by providing those dotnet-cli commands a solution filter file.
This can allow you to independently version or release different DataMiner Application Packages.

## Creating a Solution Filter

1. **Open a Solution** (`.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022.

1. Select the projects you want to work with by unloading the others (right-click a project > **Unload**).

1. From the menu, choose **File** > **Save As Solution Filter** and give it a name (e.g., `MyProjectSubset.slnf`).

This generates a **.slnf** file that references the original **.sln** but only loads the selected projects.

## Structure of a Solution Filter File

A basic example of a **.slnf** file:

```json
{
  "solution": {
    "path": "MySolution.sln"
  },
  "projects": [
    "src/MyProject/MyProject.csproj",
    "tests/MyProject.Tests/MyProject.Tests.csproj"
  ]
}
```

Here, only the **MyProject** and **MyProject.Tests** projects are loaded when you open this solution filter.

## Benefits in .NET and C# Projects

Consider a **.NET solution** with multiple projects: a web API, a class library, and a set of unit tests. Suppose you are debugging a bug related to a library function. Instead of loading the entire solution, you can create a solution filter that includes only:

- The **class library** project (`LibraryProject.csproj`).
- The **unit test** project (`LibraryProject.Tests.csproj`).

This setup ensures you can focus on the relevant projects, reducing distractions and speeding up the development workflow.

## Benefits in Skyline DataMiner SDK

You can easily publish or build a specific subset of projects by providing those dotnet-cli commands a solution filter file.
This can allow you to independently version or release different DataMiner Application Packages.

## Switching Between Solution Filters

Multiple **.slnf** files can be created for different contexts. For example:

- `CoreDevelopment.slnf` (loads core library and shared utilities)

- `WebAPIDevelopment.slnf` (loads the web API and its dependencies)

- `FullBuild.slnf` (loads everything for integration testing or deployment)

Developers can switch between these solution filters to tailor their working environment efficiently.

## Conclusion

Solution filters in Visual Studio 2022 are essential when working with large **.NET** or **C#** solutions. They allow developers to reduce load times, focus on relevant projects, and improve productivity by providing a streamlined development environment. They also provide us with the ability to publish or create a subset of DataMiner Application Packages.
